Responsive Landing Page Practice Project

Overview➡️

This is a practice project for building a responsive landing page using React and Tailwind CSS. The project focuses on creating a clean, modern UI with responsive design features, including a grid layout, fluid typography, and a dynamic header with a burger menu for mobile devices.

Features➡️

Responsive Grid Layout: A 4-column grid on large screens that collapses into a 2-column or single-column layout on smaller screens.

Fluid Typography: Font sizes scale smoothly with viewport width using clamp() for better readability across devices.

Dynamic Header: A responsive navigation bar that switches between a horizontal menu on desktop and a burger menu on mobile (below 1280px).

Tailwind CSS Styling: Utilizes Tailwind's utility-first approach for consistent and responsive styling.

Heroicons Integration: Uses @heroicons/react for icons in the navigation menu.

Tech Stack➡️

React: For building the UI components.

Tailwind CSS: For styling and responsive design.
